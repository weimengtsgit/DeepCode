# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-10 19:22:25
**File Implemented**: README.md

**Core Purpose**:  
- This file serves as the project's main documentation, providing an overview of the repository structure, purpose, and initial setup instructions for contributors and users.

**Public Interface**:  
- None (this is a markdown documentation file with no executable interface).

**Internal Dependencies**:  
- None (as a README, it does not import any modules or files).

**External Dependencies**:  
- Expected to be viewed by developers, contributors, and CI/CD systems during onboarding or project exploration.  
- Key exports used elsewhere: N/A

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Architecture decisions: The README establishes a modular project structure upfront (e.g., separating algorithms, environments, experiments, and utilities), guiding future implementation.  
- Cross-File Relationships: It sets the foundation for directory creation and expectations but does not depend on any code files.
