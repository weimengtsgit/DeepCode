Let me break down what I did:\n\n1. File Tree Structure Extracted:\n   - The plan specified a structured file tree for the WebPerf Scout project\n   - Located in the `file_structure` section under `complete_reproduction_plan`\n\n2. Shell Commands Generated:\n   - Created directories using `mkdir -p` for each directory in the structure\n   - Created files using `touch` for each specified file\n   - Added a `.gitkeep` file in the empty `templates` directory to preserve the directory structure\n\n3. Execution Details:\n   - Target Directory: `/Users/thj/Documents/学习/相关学习资料/相关学习资料/AI/project/DeepCode/ui/deepcode_lab/papers/11/generate_code/`\n   - All 18 commands were executed successfully\n   - Created the full `webperf-scout/` directory structure with all specified files and directories\n\nThe structure is now ready for further development of the WebPerf Scout web performance analysis CLI tool. \n\nNote: Since this is a JavaScript/TypeScript project, I did not include `__init__.py` files as they are typically used in Python projects.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the file structure or help you with the next steps of the project implementation?", 'code_implementation': "Failed to generate final report: 'CallToolResult' object has no attribute 'get'"}, 'mcp_architecture': 'standard'}
