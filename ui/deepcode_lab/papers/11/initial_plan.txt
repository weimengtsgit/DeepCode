# WebPerf Scout - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE: This implementation plan is based on limited tool iterations and may require additional verification. More comprehensive research would have enhanced the accuracy and depth of the implementation details.

## Additional Research Needed:
- Detailed specification of exact performance metrics
- Latest browser performance API compatibility
- Comprehensive cross-browser testing strategies
- Updated web performance measurement techniques

  implementation_components: |
    Core Performance Measurement Components:
    1. CLI Module:
       - Command-line argument parsing
       - Specification loading
       - Task orchestration
    
    2. Web Crawler:
       - URL discovery algorithm
       - Depth and breadth control
       - Domain filtering
    
    3. Performance Engine:
       Key Metrics Collection:
       - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
       - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
       - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
       - Time to Interactive (TTI)
       - Total Blocking Time (TBT)

       Measurement Techniques:
       - Playwright browser automation
       - Device and network simulation
       - Resource timing collection
       - Screenshot capture

  validation_approach: |
    Performance Validation Strategy:
    1. Metric Verification
       - Compare against browser performance APIs
       - Cross-reference with Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)
    
    2. Scoring Algorithm Validation
       - Implement threshold-based scoring
       - Create test cases covering various performance scenarios
    
    3. Crawler Accuracy Tests
       - Validate URL discovery mechanism
       - Test depth and breadth limitations
    
    Expected Validation Metrics:
    - Score correlation > 0.95
    - Crawler accuracy > 90%
    - Measurement consistency across devices

  environment_setup: |
    Required Dependencies:
    - Node.js (v18+)
    - Playwright
    - TypeScript
    - YAML configuration parser
    
    Recommended Development Environment:
    - Docker for containerization
    - CI/CD pipeline integration
    - Cross-browser testing infrastructure

  implementation_strategy: |
    Phased Implementation Approach:
    Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
    - CLI module development
    - Configuration validation
    - Basic crawling mechanism

    Phase 2: Performance Collection
    - Integrate Playwright
    - Implement performance metric collection
    - Develop scoring algorithm

    Phase 3: Reporting & Optimization
    - Design report templates
    - Implement result generation
    - Add advanced filtering and analysis

    Key Challenges & Mitigations:
    - Web Crawling Complexity: Implement strict constraints
    - Performance Measurement: Use robust browser automation
    - Security: Restrict to HTTPS, prevent arbitrary execution

  recommended_tech_stack:
    - Language: TypeScript/Node.js
    - Web Automation: Playwright
    - CLI: Commander.js
    - Configuration: YAML
    - Reporting: Handlebars/EJS templates
```

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Validate core architecture against latest web performance standards
2. Create comprehensive test suite
3. Develop detailed documentation
4. Implement continuous integration pipeline

By following this implementation plan, developers can reproduce the WebPerf Scout tool with a structured, systematic approach to web performance analysis.
