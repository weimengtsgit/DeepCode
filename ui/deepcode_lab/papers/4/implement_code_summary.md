# Code Implementation Summary
**Generated**: 2025-12-11 14:19:09
**File Implemented**: main.py

**Core Purpose**:  
- This file serves as the main entry point for the DeepCode Lab application, coordinating the initialization and execution flow of experiments. It currently provides a basic structure to launch the system.

**Public Interface**:  
- Function `main()`: Initializes and runs the DeepCode Lab experiments -> `None`: Prints initialization and completion messages.

**Internal Dependencies**:  
- None: This file does not import any internal modules or components.

**External Dependencies**:  
- Expected to be imported by: (Likely) command-line execution; no current internal dependents.
- Key exports used elsewhere: Not applicable — no other files currently depend on this implementation.

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Architecture decisions: The design follows a procedural entry pattern with a `main()` function guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":`, supporting future modularity.
- Cross-File Relationships: Will serve as the central coordinator once algorithmic and environment modules are implemented.
