First adding the implementation plan file to this directory\n2. Then running this analysis again\n\nWithout the implementation plan, I cannot proceed with creating the correct file structure as requested.\n\nWould you like me to create a basic default structure instead, or would you prefer to add the implementation plan first?', 'code_implementation': "Failed to generate final report: 'CallToolResult' object has no attribute 'get'"}, 'mcp_architecture': 'standard'}
